# Twitter4j4r

A thin, woefully inadequate wrapper around [twitter4j](http://twitter4j.org/)
that currently only supports the stream api with keywords. It will only work
under JRuby.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'twitter4j4r'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install twitter4j4r

## Usage

The api is inspired by [tweetstream](https://github.com/intridea/tweetstream/):

    @client = Twitter4j4r::Client.new(:consumer_key => 'ABC123',
                                      :consumer_secret => 'ABC234',
                                      :access_token => 'ABC345',
                                      :access_secret => 'ABC456')
    
    @client.on_exception do |exception|
      puts "An error occurred - #{exception.message}"
    end
    
    @client.track('bieber') do |tweet|
      puts "#{tweet.user.screen_name} says #{tweet.text}"
    end

    # some time later
    @client.stop

Blocks passed to `track` and `on_exception` can accept optionally accept
a second argument that will be the client instance (similar to tweetstream):

    @client.track('bieber') do |tweet, client|
      if tweet.text =~ /marry me/
        puts "grody"
        client.stop
      else
        puts "#{tweet.user.screen_name} says #{tweet.text}"
      end
    end

Authentication can also be performed by:

    @config = Twitter4j4r::Config.new
    @config.username = 'username'
    @config.password = 'password'
    
    @client = Twitter4j4r::Client.new(@config)

Or:

    @config = Twitter4j4r::Config.new
    @config.consumer_key         = 'ABC456'
    @config.consumer_secret      = 'ABC456'
    @config.access_token         = 'ABC456'
    @config.access_token_secret  = 'ABC456'
    
    @client = Twitter4j4r::Client.new(@config)


## Why?

Because tweetstream uses EventMachine, and EM doesn't support TLS
under JRuby, so is unusable. 

Thanks to [Marek Jelen](https://github.com/marekjelen) for the inspiration.

## Isn't twitter4j4r a crappy name?

Yes! But I was a hair away from naming it `twitter4j4r4u-and-me`, so take
what you're given.
